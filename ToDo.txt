- UsersController -> How to correctly send a 401 Unauthorized if the authenciate_user! fails in the application controller


Angular Stuff

- Page load blip --> ng-cloak

- Roadmap.html -> how to put templates in separate file?
  - Along with that, ng-incude with a string built up reloads full page
    In roadmap.html (from http://lostechies.com/gabrielschenker/2013/12/28/angularjspart-6-templates/)

    <div ng-show="selected.module" class="milestone ptl" ng-include="'/assets/add_'+selected.module.submoduleType.toLowerCase()+'.html'"> but ng-include="'/assets/add_academics_gpa.html'" works just fine

- Angular best practices for authorization (Admin only can see this page, etc)
-- roles and permissions

- Full angular header with different links for different people

- Caching objects between pages, e.g. Roadmap can be cached after the first time you go to the roadmap page until the user refreshes their screen

- Do I need to resolve user session it before every controller? Is it possible to go to a route before hitting the first route where the resolve is?
